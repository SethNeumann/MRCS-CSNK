The CSNK Version 2 plugs into a cpNode, IOX16 or IOX32 and provides 16 high voltage/current outputs using the ULN2803 chip.  Loads of up to 48 Volts and 0.5A may 
handled (but not all 16 at once!).  Internal clamp diodes are provided for inductive loads (see application note).  Outputs are 0.100" centers and headers and screw
terminals are available.  The CSNK is ideal for situations where you need to drive high current devices (incandescent lamps) and inductive loads.  CSNK offers
compatibility with existing signaling systems or CTC Console using 12-48VDC power for signals.

If you need to drive more than 0.5A, check out our Sounder Driver which can handle up to 10A (momentary) and provides a clamping diode.
